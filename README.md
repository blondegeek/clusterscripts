clusterscripts
==============

shell, python, and fortran scripts that I use on nersc and lbl clusters

All scripts assume that directories pythonscripts, fortranscripts, and bashscripts are in your home director (~/). I find the easiest thing to do is to create softlinks from the clusterscripts directory folders.
