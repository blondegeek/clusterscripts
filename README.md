clusterscripts
==============

shell, python, and fortran scripts that I use on nersc and lbl clusters

All scripts assume that directories pythonscripts, fortranscripts, and bashscripts are in your home director (~/). I find the easiest thing to do is to create softlinks from the clusterscripts directory folders.

Also note, that the python scripts depend heavily on pymatgen package -- some of the magnetism scripts even depend on specific modifications I've made to the pymatgen package. I intend on commiting these changes soon.
